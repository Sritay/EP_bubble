# Bubble Dynamics Simulation

This Python project simulates the dynamics of a bubble in a liquid containing dissolved gases using the Epstein-Plesset model, modified to account for changes in the concentration of dissolved gases. The simulation provides insights into how the bubble's radius changes over time under various conditions.

## Description

The script uses numerical methods to solve the Epstein-Plesset equations, taking into account the effects of variable gas concentration within the bubble. This is achieved by adjusting the saturation concentration of the gas dynamically throughout the simulation period.

## Features

- Calculation of bubble radius over time using fsolve for the Epstein-Plesset equation.
- Dynamic adjustment of dissolved gas concentration.
- Visualization of the bubble radius change over time.
